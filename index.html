        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Raman Raj Shrivastava, born on 17th September 2005. I am an Indian citizen, and my family currently resides in Angul, Odisha, though my roots trace back to Bihar. My father, Vijay Kumar Shrivastava, and my mother, Sujata Shrivastava, have always been my pillars of support and inspiration.
            
            I have recently begun a new chapter in my academic journey by enrolling in B.Tech Computer Science Engineering at K.R. Mangalam University, Sohna, Gurugram, Haryana, India. At present, I am in my first semester, stepping into the world of higher education with curiosity and determination.
            
            As a person, I see myself as adaptive, thoughtful, and eager to learn. Writing is another part of who I am—I regularly express my ideas and perspectives through blogs. Friends describe me as approachable and calm. Above all, I strive to remain a learner—curious, reflective, and open-minded in everything I do.
